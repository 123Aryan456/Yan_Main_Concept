**README**

Well, I’ve crafted this concept design for Yan’s main website, built entirely from scratch. There’s nothing quite like rolling up your sleeves and diving into pure code. This project showcases Yan’s innovations, projects, and technological expertise in a multi-page layout.

**Overview**

This repository contains the prototype for Yan’s personal website. It’s a fully hand-coded project, featuring multiple sections that highlight his work, blog posts, and ways to connect.

**What’s Inside**

	•	Handwritten HTML and CSS: Every element and style is carefully coded to provide a clean and efficient structure.
	•	JavaScript Enhancements: Leveraged vanilla JavaScript along with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Locomotive Scroll for smooth animations and scrolling effects.
	•	Responsive Design: Ensured the site is accessible and looks sharp on devices of all sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile phones.
	•	Rich Media Integration: Incorporated images and videos to bring Yan’s world to life. Just make sure to place your media files in the appropriate directories.

**Getting Started**

To explore this concept site on your own machine, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**

	•	A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
	•	No additional installations are required.

**Installation**

	1.	Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yan-website-concept.git


	2.	Navigate to the Project Directory

cd yan-website-concept


	3.	Open the Website
Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

	•	index.html: The main HTML file containing the website structure.
	•	style.css: CSS stylesheet for styling the website.
	•	script.js: JavaScript file for animations and interactive features.
	•	images/: Directory for image assets.
	•	videos/: Directory for video files.

**Features**

	•	Navigation Bar: Includes Yan’s logo and buttons for contacting him and accessing the menu.
	•	Dynamic Content: Sections that scroll smoothly and provide engaging visuals, thanks to Locomotive Scroll and GSAP.
	•	Blog Section: Highlights Yan’s recent blog posts with images and dates.
	•	Social Media Links: Sample links to Yan’s Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram profiles.
	•	Responsive and Interactive Design: Ensures a user-friendly experience across all devices.

**JavaScript Libraries**

Here’s a list of the libraries I used in this project:
-	**GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Utilized GSAP to create smooth animations and transitions throughout the site. It brings the elements to life, making the scrolling experience more engaging.
-	**ScrollTrigger (GSAP Plugin):** Employed ScrollTrigger to synchronize animations with the scroll position. As you scroll down the page, various elements animate in tandem, enhancing interactivity.
-	**Locomotive Scroll:** Implemented Locomotive Scroll for smooth scrolling and subtle parallax effects. It gives the site that modern, fluid feel and makes navigation seamless.
-	**Remix Icon:** Incorporated icons from Remix Icon to add visual appeal to buttons and links, enhancing the overall user interface.
-	**Custom JavaScript (script.js):** Wrote custom JavaScript code to handle specific functionalities like animating text by splitting it into individual characters, creating canvas animations using sequences of images, and integrating all the libraries together for a cohesive experience.

Notes

	•	Concept Design: This is an initial concept intended as a foundation for the main website. It can be expanded and customized as needed.
	•	Built from Scratch: No reliance on heavy frameworks or templates, providing full control over the codebase.
	•	Customization: Feel free to modify and enhance the project to suit Yan’s needs.
